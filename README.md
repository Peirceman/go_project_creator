# go_project_creator

creates a simple go project

## usage
You can just install it.
```console
 $ go install github.com/Peirceman/go_project_creator@latest
```

Or you can download the source code and compile, either it with make:
``` console
 $ make
```

or manualy:
``` console
 $ go build
```

and run the executable. There are commandline-options which you can see with `--help`,
but they are only reccomended for use in scripts. Just run the executable without options
and you will be prompted.
